cross-gl
========

Hopefully, renders a cross-section of a 3D model using Three.js

Installation
============

Since this isn't on npm yet, clone this repo and:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```

Running `install` via `npm` will install the dependancies `beefy` and `three.js`.

To make sure that everything is installed correctly, run `npm run test` to start the `beefy` server on the default port: `9966`

If all goes well you should see a scene of a rotating star field with an earth and moon object.
